          <p>
            As a beginner learning Full-stack development,
            I have gained foundational knowledge in both Front-end and Back-end technologies.
            I started by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to build simple, interactive web pages.
            As I progressed, I began exploring server-side development with technologies like Node.js and Express,
            while also gaining an understanding of databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. Although I am just starting,
            I'm committed to developing my skills and building projects that showcase my ability to create complete web applications
            from start to finish.
